      Back when the earth was the center of the universe, it was believed that
      the ground underneath us was stationary and the entire universe revolves
      around us. Afterall, we don't <i>seem</i> to be moving while the celestial
      bodies in the night sky are all spinning around us. We expected all the
      bodies to be in a roughly circular orbit around the earth

      However, we noticed that there were some celestial bodies that moved in
      an odd motion. They seemed to move roughly in a circular orbit, but
      sometimes move backwards, in a retrograde orbit. These bodies are the other
      planets that revolve around the sun. We now know that this apparant motion
      is due to the fact that the earth is also revolving around the sun.

      A smart guy named Ptolemy noticed that he could model the motion of
      planets by using a model with epicycles. Planets seemed to revolve around
      a point that was itself revolving. The assumed model for how planets
      moved was like this:

    <p>
      Notice that the planets do occasionally move back in retrograde motion when
      you're looking from inside the circle.

    <h2>Math behind Using Epicycles to trace any path</h2>
    <p>
      A complex number can be represented as a combination of real and imaginary
      parts, <eq>a + ib</eq>, but it can also be represented by its magnitude
      and phase. Euler's formula gives the relation:
      <eq>re^{i\theta}=rcos(\theta)+irsin(\theta)</eq>. This is the more
      general formula of <eq>e^{i\pi}=-1</eq>. Because the magnitude of
      <eq>a+ib</eq> is <eq>\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}</eq> and the phase of
      <eq>a+ib</eq> is <eq>atan2(b,a)</eq>, <eq>re^{i\theta}</eq>
      can be used to represent a complex number with magniutde <eq>r</eq> and
      phase <eq>\theta</eq>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A circle on the imaginary plane can be represented by a complex number as
      the center <eq>x + iy</eq> and a radius <eq>r</eq>. A point traveling
      along this circle requires a few additional parameters. We need to know
      it's angular velocity <eq>\omega=2\pi f</eq> where <eq>f</eq> is the point's
      frequency, how many times it makes a complete orbit every second. Lastly,
      we must also know the point's starting position along the circle at time
      <eq>t = 0</eq>, this is the phase <eq>\theta</eq>. Together,
      <eq>\omega t + \theta</eq> represents the point's phase at some time
      <eq>t</eq> while <eq>r</eq> represents its magnitude.
      A complex number can be represented using a complex
      exponential. We can encode where our point is at time
      <eq>t</eq> as <eq>x + iy + re^{i(\omega t+\theta)}</eq>.
      By assuming our circle is centered around the origin, the relation is
      reduced to <eq>re^{i(\omega t+\theta)}</eq>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can create an epicycle with two rotating orbits. The first orbit
      <eq>r_{1}e^{i(\omega_{1}t+\theta_{1})}</eq> is centered at a point
      traveling around the second orbit
      <eq>r_{2}e^{i(\omega_{2}t+\theta_{2})}</eq> which is centered at the
      origin. The equation for a point's position on the first orbit at time <eq>t</eq>
      is <eq>r_{2}e^{i(\omega_{2}t+\theta_{2})}+r_{1}e^{i(\omega_{1}t+\theta_{1})}</eq>.
      We can extend this to <eq>K</eq> orbits. The equation will
      look like <eq>\sum_{k=1}^{K}r_{k}e^{i(\omega_{k}t+\theta_{k})}</eq>. We can
      factor this to be <eq>\sum_{k=1}^{K}r_{k}e^{i\theta_{k}}e^{i\omega_{k}t}</eq>.
      Read this way, we can say that our path is the sum of each angular frequency
      <eq>\omega_{k}</eq>'s contribution <eq>r_{k}e^{i\theta_{k}}</eq>. If we know
      the path that we want to construct, we will need to figure out the parameters
      <eq>r_{k},\theta_{k},\omega_{k}</eq> for <eq>K</eq> values of <eq>k</eq>.
      Breaking up a signal into its base frequencies is the Discrete Fourier Transform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our desired path or orbit is a complex signal of <eq>N</eq> elements,
      <eq>x(n)</eq>. The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of this signal is
      <eq>X_{k} = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x(n)e^{-i2\pi kn/N}</eq> for each interger
      <eq>k</eq>. <eq>X_{k}</eq> is a complex number, so it can be represented
      as a complex exponential <eq>X_{k} = r_{k}e^{i\theta_{k}}</eq>. Our
      <eq>X_{k}</eq> can therefore represent <eq>r_{k},\theta_{k}</eq> for one
      value of <eq>k</eq>. The corresponding frequency is then
      <eq>\omega_{k}=k/N</eq>. We want to only have <eq>K</eq> of those
      frequencies. The question is then which range of k to choose. Because
      lower frequencies are more representative of the path than higher
      frequencies which may represent noise, we will obtain the <eq>K</eq>
      lowest frequencies. This means <eq>k \in [-K/2, K/2]</eq>. Doing this, we
      have obtained the <eq>r_{k},\theta_{k},\omega_{k}</eq> values that are
      needed to build an epicycle with <eq>K</eq> circles. By looking at the
      Inverse Discrete Transform (IDFT) that turns our frequency components into
      an approximation of the original signal,
      <eq>x(n) = 1/N\sum_{k=-K/2}^{K/2}X_{k}e^{i2\pi kn/N}</eq> we see that it
      matches our previous summation except for a scaling factor of <eq>1/N</eq>
      outside of the summation. Each <eq>X_{k}</eq> is constructed by summing
      <eq>N</eq> values together, so it makes sense to divide each magnitude by
      <eq>N</eq> to achieve the original signal.
